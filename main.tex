\section{Proof of Concept}
The aim of this project is to view multiple sources at the same time in one place in order to draw connections between them. Depending on their shared themes, they will be tagged and annotated accordingly and stored using the same program for ease of future access.

\section{Programs used}
\subsection{Voyant}
This project uses Voyant within the web browser. This can be accessed here: https://voyant-tools.org/. For reliability purposes, Voyant tools was deemed more reliable than Voyant server which is installed and worked offline on the computer hard drive. While this is also an option, it did not perform consistently in tests so the browser was chosen as the better option.
\subsection{Zotero}
Zotero has been selected as a storage program. The program was installed from here: https://www.zotero.org/. It works offline on the hard drive once installed and also connects to the browser, an additional connector must be installed for this. Mozilla Firefox was chosen for this particular case. 

\section{Set up}
The following steps are required in order to ensure efficiency for completing the proof of conept:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Install Zotero from https://www.zotero.org/
    \item Select browser and install the browser connector. This is so Zotero can access files straight from the browser and save them to the library.
    \item Check that the Zotero connector appears in the top right corner above the web browser toolbar. It should appear as a "Z" or an icon image of a piece of paper. Waving the mouse over the icon will show the following message: "Save to Zotero". 
    \item If using Voyant server, the latest version of java must be updated. Can be installed from here: https://www.java.com/en/download/
    \item If using Voyant server, access the download here: http://docs.voyant-tools.org/resources/run-your-own/voyant-server/
    \item If using Voyant tools via a web browser, type the url into the search bar: https://voyant-tools.org/
    \item Add Voyant website to the bookmarks toolbar or save to favourites for easier access in future.
\end{itemize}
Once these steps are complete, the process for identifying shared themes and storing sources is able to begin. 

\section{Workflow Process}
\subsection{Finding and downloading sources}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Open Zotero on computer first. Keep open in background before opening web browser.
    \item Access chosen database or original source online. For the purposes of this project, Macquarie University database was used. (Due to restrictions as a result of privacy and institutional access, there will be some differences).
    \item Search key words for chosen topic, assignment, research idea etc.
    \item Access sources directly through logging in to database server, accessing pdf and clicking on the Zotero connector in the top right corner.
    \item Pdf source will save to Zotero library.
     \item Check Zotero library that source appears. In right hand panel, check that appropriate metadata is there. If source is reliable all metadata will appear (author, data, title, journal, volume & issue number, pages). If metadata is missing, add manually from the source location on database. If metadata is not available, re-consider the reliability of source as it may not be valid for research purposes.
    \item At the same time, download pdf source to a new directory called "test" or something similar on the desktop. Pin this directory to quick access so it can be more efficiently accessed in future. Save all sources to this folder. This directory will be used to upload sources to Voyant. 
  \end{enumerate}

\subsection{Identifying commonalities between sources}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Open a new browser tab or window, and type in url: https://voyant-tools.org/ to access Voyant tools on browser.
    \item The Voyant homepage should show a box in the middle of the page where text can be copied and pasted. Due to restrictions on institutional access, sources will be uploaded from the computer. However, other sources which have open access can be transferred directly to Voyant through copying and pasting the url.
    \item To upload sources, click on the bottom left button of the textbook called "upload". This will open an upload window.
    \item Click on "test" directory which is pinned to quick access on the left hand side of the upload window. All sources are stored there, select the sources to upload to Voyant for comparison.
    \item Upload sources to Voyant. Select "reveal".
    \item Voyant will redirect to a page which shows all sources. There are 5 separate sections which are all different tools. Voyant will automatically display default tools which are: cirrus, reader, trends, summary and contexts. There is an icon next to each tool where they can be changed to suit the purposes of the student/researcher.
    \item To identify commonalities, the trends tool and reader tool are particularly helpful. These tools show re-occurring key words and themes in the sources and can pinpoint their exact locations. This helps the student/researcher see what topic areas these sources cover. This highlights possible paths for further study or research.
